# Installation and Usage

::: noheader
internetx/php-domainrobot-sdk is a composer package. 
:::

Official sources:

* [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/internetx/php-domainrobot-sdk)
* [github repository](https://github.com/InterNetX/php-domainrobot-sdk)

If you have no prior experience with composer or do not know what composer is please refer to their official documentation at: [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org)

## Installation

```bash
composer require internetx/php-domainrobot-sdk
```

If you do not use a php-framework like [Laravel](https://laravel.com), [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com),[CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/), [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) you need to require/import the composer generated autoloader manually.

```php
// path to package: vendor/internetx/php-domainrobot-sdk
require_once "vendor/autoload.php";

// now you can import the parts of the SDK you want to use
use Domainrobot\Domainrobot;
```

internetx/php-domainrobot-sdk uses the [PSR-4: Autoloader](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) so once you installed the package via composer and required the autoload.php file you can start to implement your first task.

## Usage

Before you can interact with the API you need to specify your authentication credentials, the baseurl and the context.

```php
use Domainrobot\Domainrobot;
use Domainrobot\Lib\DomainrobotAuth;

$domainrobot = new Domainrobot([
    "url" => "https://api.autodns.com/v1",
    "auth" => new DomainrobotAuth([
        "user" => "user",
        "password" => "password",
        "context" => 4
    ])
]);
```
